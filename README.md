This notebook is used to analyze the 'Automobile Data Set' from the UC Irvine Machine Learning repository. The dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile). This notebook is based on a previous project we did, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/gabrielleuzinger/Automobile_price). 

**Therefore, we do not make many considerations about the regression models used. The focus is on the interpretation of what the ML models used to predict the cars price are doing**.

This project was set up following the premises of [Reproducible Research](https://pt.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research), so that anyone can achieve the same results as me using the steps I followed in Jupyter Notebook.

# Project libraries


All dependencies can be found in the file  `requirements.txt`, but are also listed below:
* Numpy
* Scikit-Learn
* Shap
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib

To install the dependencies run in the project's main folder : `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

To access the Jupyter Notebook that I created, run in the root folder of the `jupyter notebook` project. Soon after, your browser will open and just select the file `SHAP - Automobile Data Set.ipynb`.  

# Project structure

```{sh}
  .
  |-report
  |  |- SHAP - Automobile Data Set.md
  |- data
  |- SHAP - Automobile Data Set.ipynb
  |- requirements.txt
```

The folder `report` contains an md file with a version of the report generated from the study done on that project. This file contains **all the insights and studies that were done, as well as a detailed description of how the project was developed**.

**All references used to create this project are described in the report**.
